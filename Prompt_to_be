To determine if a game is worth playing, you need to specify which game you are asking about. Without knowing the game's title, it's impossible to provide a helpful answer. However, once you provide the game's name, you can find information on review sites like Rotten Tomatoes or Common Sense Media or game-specific forums like IMDb to help you decide if it's a good fit for you. 
What factors to consider when deciding if a game is worth it?

    Genre and Style: Consider if the game's genre (e.g., puzzle, action, strategy) and overall style (e.g., realistic, cartoonish, serious) align with your preferences. 

Critical and Audience Reviews: Look at reviews from both professional critics and other players. What are the common praises and criticisms? 
Gameplay: Read or watch gameplay to understand the mechanics and core loop. 
Length and Value: Consider the amount of content the game offers and the price. 
Community and Longevity: If it's a multiplayer game, check out Steam Charts or similar sites to see if there is a healthy player base. 
Technical Aspects: Look for information on bugs, performance issues, and overall polish.
